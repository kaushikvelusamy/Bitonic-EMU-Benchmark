To compile
=============

make clean
	deletes *.cdc *.part.tqd *.tqd *.vsf *.mwx files
make 
	compiles the ORIGINAL Bitonic Sort Iterative Code to be executed in the HARDWARE without array pointer changes
	[Original Code, Hardware]
make DEBUG=1
	compiles the ORIGINAL Bitonic Sort Iterative Code to check whether the algorithm works correctly without array pointer changes
	[Original Code, No HW/SIM, Just to DEBUG the Algorithm]
make SIMULATOR=1	
	compiles the ORIGINAL Bitonic Sort Iterative Code to be executed in the SIMULATOR without array pointer changes
	[Orignal Code, SIMULATOR]

make SIMULATOR=2
	compiles the ORIGINAL Bitonic Sort Iterative Code to be executed in the SIMULATOR (with DEBUG statements) without array pointer changes
	[Orignal Code, SIMULATOR, DEBUG]

make POINTER=1
	compiles the MODIFIED Bitonic Sort Iterative Code to be executed in the HARDWARE with array pointer changes
	[Modified Code, Hardware]

make POINTER=2
	compiles the MODIFIED Bitonic Sort Iterative Code to check whether the algorithm works correctly with array pointer changes
	[Modified Code,  No HW/SIM, Just to DEBUG the Algorithm]

make POINTER=3
	compiles the MODIFIED Bitonic Sort Iterative Code to be executed in the SIMULATOR with array pointer changes
	[Modified Code, SIMULATOR]

make POINTER=4
	compiles the MODIFIED Bitonic Sort Iterative Code to be executed in the SIMULATOR (with DEBUG statements) with array pointer changes
	[Modified Code, SIMULATOR, DEBUG]
